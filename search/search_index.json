Am I affected by it? If you are running Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS (key part here, it being arm 32-bit), your docker container all of a sudden stops working and you appear to be the only person in the world to have this happen... Rest assured you are not alone. The issue here is that you are probably running an outdated version of libseccomp2. The symptom can vary in many ways depending on the app. Radarr for example does nothing (no error or anything), Mylar3 gives this Fatal Python error: pyinit_main: can't initialize time , Overseerr gives you Fatal error in , line 0 , docker exec <container-name> date returns 1970 and the list goes on. The fastest way to detect if that is indeed your issue is by running the container in --privileged mode (I understand that you are not comfortable with this, and you should avoid running privileged at all costs), if it works after doing this, you now know you're a victim too. If you really don't like doing this, doing docker exec <container-name> date might confirm it too if you are 100% sure your system date is working as expected. Several solutions: Upgrade your OS to Ubuntu 20.04 arm64 image (found here ). Manually update libseccomp2 (found here ). wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libs/libseccomp/libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb sudo dpkg -i libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb Keep running with --privileged , not recommended though. The prefered way here is going with Ubuntu + ARM64 if you can. Info Make sure you are running the latest Docker Engine . Installation \u00b6 How do I install 'docker-compose' on my machine? There's all sorts of ways to do this, here we are going to pick the easy way. The following commands will download and install a wrapper script that uses the docker image linuxserver/docker-compose . sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-docker-compose/master/run.sh > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Now you should be able to do docker-compose --version as if it were natively installed. This script doesn't pull for the latest image though everytime it runs, so it might be a good idea to once in a while purge the image. It'll then pull a new one the next time it runs. Installing Docker, how and where? I'd have a look at the official Docker Engine installation instructions. Guides \u00b6 I would like to execute my own scripts on startup, how would I do this? This will only work for containers using s6 overlay , recognisable by ENVIRONMENT printed at the top of the log when the container starts. If you have a need to do additional stuff when the container starts or stops, you can mount your script with the volume /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-init.d/99-my-script to execute your script on container start or /docker/host/my-script.sh:/etc/cont-finish.d/99-my-script to execute it when the container stops. An example script can be seen below. 1 2 3 #!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash echo \"Hello, this is me, your script.\" How do I use this 'docker-compose' to start all my apps? First you'll need to create a file called docker-compose.yml in a location that you like, adjust below example to your liking. cd ~/ mkdir ./compose nano ./compose/docker-compose.yml Now you can copy/paste your services into this file. See example below. Don't forget to adjust or add more volumes and set the environment variables according to your situation. version: \"3.7\" services: cloudflareddns: container_name: cloudflareddns image: hotio/cloudflareddns environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - UMASK=002 - TZ=Etc/UTC - INTERVAL=300 - DETECTION_MODE=dig-whoami.cloudflare - LOG_LEVEL=3 - cloudflareddns - CF_USER=your.cf.email@example.com - CF_APIKEY=your.global.apikey - CF_APITOKEN - CF_APITOKEN_ZONE - CF_HOSTS=test.example.com;test.foobar.com;test2.foobar.com - CF_ZONES=example.com;foobar.com;foobar.com - CF_RECORDTYPES=A;A;AAAA volumes: - /<host_folder_config>:/config restart: unless-stopped qflood: container_name: qflood image: hotio/qflood ports: - \"8080:8080\" - \"3000:3000\" environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - UMASK=002 - TZ=Etc/UTC - FLOOD_AUTH=false volumes: - /<host_folder_config>:/config restart: unless-stopped If we now do cd ~/compose , followed by docker-compose up -d all our containers should start.

When making adjustments to our docker-compose.yml file, we do docker-compose up -d and all containers that had modifications will be recreated. How can I get a static IP for one of my containers using 'docker-compose'?

Pullio is a bash script that you execute with cron, jobber , a systemd timer or any other way that you prefer, it then does a docker-compose pull for all the containers configured to have notifications or updates enabled. It then checks if there's an update available and takes action according to your configuration. As you might have already guessed it, this script relies on docker-compose to do the heavy lifting and thus is only compatible with docker-compose managed containers. Features: Discord notifications (see below for preview) No notifications if you leave the webhook out, it'll run as an updater and script executer Detailed info about what has changed for images that follow the Opencontainers Annotation Keys Execute script before sending notification Execute script before updating container, after container is stopped Private registries With --tag you can use seperate configs for hourly \"Update available\" notifications and on a daily schedule actually apply the updates Installation \u00b6 sudo curl -fsSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotio/pullio/master/pullio.sh\" -o /usr/local/bin/pullio sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pullio Now execute it however and whenever you want.

Tag Upstream Version Commit Last Updated Zone ID \u00b6 Instead of the zone_name , you can also fill in a zone_id in CF_ZONES . When using a zone_id , you can use a scoped token ( CF_APITOKEN ) that only needs the Zone - DNS - Edit permissions. This improves security. The configuration could look like the example below. -e CF_APITOKEN = \"azkqvJ86wEScojvSJC8DyY67TwqNwZCtomEVrHwt\" -e CF_HOSTS = \"example.com;test.foobar.com\" -e CF_ZONES = \"zbpsi9ceikrdnnym27s2xnp6s5dvj6ep;dccbe6grakumohwwd4amh4o46yupepn8\" -e CF_RECORDTYPES = \"A;A\" Seperate API Tokens \u00b6 If you do not prefer to use a zone_id , but prefer some more security, you can use 2 seperate tokens. CF_APITOKEN configured with: Permissions Zone - DNS - Edit Zone Resources Include - Specific zone - example.com Include - Specific zone - foobar.com CF_APITOKEN_ZONE configured with: Permissions Zone - Zone - Read Zone Resources Include - All zones Leaving CF_APITOKEN_ZONE blank would mean that only CF_APITOKEN will be used and thus that token should have all required permissions. Which usually means that the token could edit all zones or not be able to fetch the zone_id from the zone_name . Configuration combination examples \u00b6 Below are some example configuration combinations, ordered from most secure to least secure.

Open Chrome DevTools (usually F12) and open the Console tab, then refresh your browser window. One of the very first lines you will see is [Servers] Initialize server with token, ... , in that message you should see some url that looks like https://10-1-0-100.xxxxxxxxxxxxx.plex.direct:32400 . Part of that url can be used in your Overseerr settings, the part 10-1-0-100.xxxxxxxxxxxxx.plex.direct is what you'll need to copy/paste, the port is in a seperate input box and enable SSL.

Tag Upstream Version Commit Last Updated Changing the WebUI port \u00b6 Under certain circumstances it's required to run the WebUI on a different internal port, you can do that by modifying the environment variable WEBUI_PORTS accordingly. It should be in the format xxxx/tcp,xxxx/udp , take a look at the default with docker logs (variable is printed at container start) or docker inspect . VueTorrent \u00b6 This image comes bundled with the alternative Web UI VueTorrent, to enable it you'll have to adjust your settings like pictured below. WireGuard VPN support \u00b6 This is probably not going to work if your OS has no kernel with WireGuard support. Tested Operating Systems: Ubuntu 18.04 Ubuntu 20.04 Unraid 6.8.3 Unraid 6.9 RC2 macOS Big Sur 11.2.1 Apple M1 There needs to be a file wg0.conf located in /config/wireguard and you need to set the variable VPN_ENABLED to true for the VPN to start. The part with net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 can be removed or set to 1 if there is no need for ipv6, no attempt will be made in that case to set ip6tables rules and can prevent an error if the module ip6table_filter isn't loaded on the host. The WireGuard configuration should not have any ipv6 related stuff when ipv6 is disabled, otherwise creating the interface will fail. If your vpn provider supports ipv6 and you keep it enabled, you'll have full ipv6 connectivity over the vpn connection (confirmed with Mullvad). If for any reason there's a failure trying to setup ip6tables rules, you'll probably need to do sudo modprobe ip6table_filter on the host, this will mostly happen on systems that have ipv6 completely disabled. The environment variable VPN_LAN_NETWORK can be set to for example 192.168.1.0/24 , 192.168.1.0/24,192.168.44.0/24 or 192.168.1.33 , so you can get access to the webui or other additional ports (see below). If you need to expose additional ports you can use VPN_ADDITIONAL_PORTS , for example VPN_ADDITIONAL_PORTS=7878/tcp,9117/tcp . Every port in this list will be blocked on the vpn interface, so that there's no risk that they might be exposed to the world via the vpn (mostly there in case your vpn provider screws up and piece of mind). Why would you need this? Wanting to route traffic from other containers over the vpn is probably the most used scenario. wg0.conf example \u00b6 This is an example of how your wg0.conf should look like. [Interface] PrivateKey = supersecretprivatekey Address = xx.xx.xxx.xxx/32 DNS = 1.1.1.1 [Peer] PublicKey = publickey AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 Endpoint = xxx.x.xxx.x:51820 TorGuard instructions \u00b6 Warning The following instructions are no longer needed if you re-download a config from the TorGuard website or if this is your first time doing it. While Mullvad is pretty straightforward to setup by using the wg0.conf example from above, TorGuard is a bit more complex. Our wg0.conf should look something like this: # TorGuard WireGuard Config [Interface] PrivateKey = secretprivatekey ListenPort = 51820 DNS = 1.1.1.1 Address = xx.xx.xxx.xx/24 PreUp = bash /config/wireguard/torguard.sh [Peer] PublicKey = publickey AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 Endpoint = xx.xxx.xx.xxx:1443 PersistentKeepalive = 25 Pay attention to PreUp = bash /config/wireguard/torguard.sh in our config. That command will execute the below script that you should create in /config/wireguard/torguard.sh , this script will get executed just before starting WireGuard. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 #!/usr/bin/bash pubkey = $( grep PrivateKey \" ${ CONFIG_DIR } /wireguard/wg0.conf\" | awk '{print $3}' | wg pubkey ) wgserver = $( grep Endpoint \" ${ CONFIG_DIR } /wireguard/wg0.conf\" | awk '{print $3}' ) curl -ksG -u \" ${ TORGUARD_USER } \" : \" ${ TORGUARD_PASS } \" \\ --data-urlencode \"public-key= ${ pubkey } \" \"https:// ${ wgserver } /api/v1/setup\" You will also have to add the additional environment variables TORGUARD_USER and TORGUARD_PASS or fill them in into the script directly (see curl command). These credentials can be found here . My experience with getting TorGuard working wasn't the smoothest journey to say the least. I had to click around quite a bit and finally after generating my 3rd config it worked. On the Netherlands server for example I didn't get any internet connectivity and at first I was unable to get port forwarding working on the Germany server. All of a sudden after generating the 3rd config and also pasting in the ip found under My Fixed IPs , that seems to populate when doing a Port Forward Request, I managed to get port forwarding working.

Tested Operating Systems: Ubuntu 18.04 Ubuntu 20.04 Unraid 6.8.3 Unraid 6.9 RC2 macOS Big Sur 11.2.1 Apple M1 There needs to be a file wg0.conf located in /config/wireguard and you need to set the variable VPN_ENABLED to true for the VPN to start. The part with net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 can be removed or set to 1 if there is no need for ipv6, no attempt will be made in that case to set ip6tables rules and can prevent an error if the module ip6table_filter isn't loaded on the host. The WireGuard configuration should not have any ipv6 related stuff when ipv6 is disabled, otherwise creating the interface will fail. If your vpn provider supports ipv6 and you keep it enabled, you'll have full ipv6 connectivity over the vpn connection (confirmed with Mullvad). If for any reason there's a failure trying to setup ip6tables rules, you'll probably need to do sudo modprobe ip6table_filter on the host, this will mostly happen on systems that have ipv6 completely disabled. The environment variable VPN_LAN_NETWORK can be set to for example 192.168.1.0/24 , 192.168.1.0/24,192.168.44.0/24 or 192.168.1.33 , so you can get access to the webui or other additional ports (see below). If you need to expose additional ports you can use VPN_ADDITIONAL_PORTS , for example VPN_ADDITIONAL_PORTS=7878/tcp,9117/tcp . Every port in this list will be blocked on the vpn interface, so that there's no risk that they might be exposed to the world via the vpn (mostly there in case your vpn provider screws up and piece of mind). Why would you need this? Wanting to route traffic from other containers over the vpn is probably the most used scenario.","title":"WireGuard VPN support"},{"location":"containers/rflood/#wg0conf-example","text":"This is an example of how your wg0.conf should look like.
